Jiayu (Alice) Wu 伍佳昱

I am a second-year Master candidate in Statistics at UCLA, supervised by Professor Y. Wu. I currently work as a research intern at Stratifyd, Inc., working with Dr. Liu on text data modeling for business insights. 

I am particularly interested in generative modeling and machine learning for vision and natural language. My ongoing project with Stratifyd is on semi-supervised text labeling based on deep generative model.

**Working Experience**    

10/2018---   Stratifyd Inc., R&D Team, Machine Learning Research Intern

· Design and deploy machine learning models on text and numerical data for business intelligence platform       
· Extend on state-of-art deep topic model and VAE for semi-supervised multi-label classification       
· Contribute in weekly team discussion and journal reading with the research and development team       

Our work is motivated by the need of labeling text data, ex. costumer reviews on products and services, in a way that fits into the traditional manually designed taxonomy framework as well as achieving better performance. Most client are used to processing their text data with a manually designed taxonomy and naive labeling method like regular expression, which
is not accurate nor efficient enough. However, train a supervised classification model with manually labled training data is costly, yet the fully unsupervised way like topic modeling does not give classes that are interpretable in a way that is conveniet for the following analytics. Therefore, we are currently developing a deep generative model by neural variational inference. It has the advantages
that: 1) it can transfer knowledge between classes and even recognize new classes by learning
class structures; 2) variational method with reparameterization trick efficiently samples the latent
representation to model probability distritbutions; 3) neural networks is flexible for training and finetuning
on different datasets.
