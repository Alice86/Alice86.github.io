Jiayu (Alice) Wu 伍佳昱

I currently work as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Stratifyd Inc, working with Dr. Liu on natural language modeling for an AI-powered business intelligence platform providing automated real time customer analysis for business owners. 
Prior to that, I graduated from UCLA with a MS degree in Statistics, supervised by Professor Y. Wu. I also have Bachelor degrees of Economics and of Arts from Xiamen University.

I am particularly interested in structured representation learning via generative learning, attnetion mechansm, graph network, etc., to facilitate the understanding of often unbalanced and noisy industrial data. My ongoing project is on semi-supervised Extreme Label Classification on text data.

• Design and deploy machine learning models for AI-powered business intelligence platform providing automated real time customer analysis for business owners [Python, Pytorch, Gensim, Spacy]      
• Develop a scalable and generalizable Extreme Label Learning (XML) framework consists of label-aware data representation, hierarchical label representation and parallelizable neural network classifiers for the Semi-auto Taxonomy feature, which improves the F1 by around 0.1 and the coverage rate by around 0.06      
• Investigate various designs of model including Attention, Generative Learning, Graph Network, etc. for effective document representation that is relevant to downstream classification tasks by leveraging label information and label relational structure to facilitate the understanding of unbalanced and noisy data          
· Contribute in weekly team discussion and journal reading with the research and development team          

<!-- Our work is motivated by the need of labeling text data, ex. costumer reviews on products and services, in a way that fits into the traditional manually designed taxonomy framework as well as achieving better performance. Most client are used to processing their text data with a manually designed taxonomy and naive labeling method like regular expression, which
is not accurate nor efficient enough. However, train a supervised classification model with manually labled training data is costly, yet the fully unsupervised way like topic modeling does not give classes that are interpretable in a way that is conveniet for the following analytics. Therefore, we are currently developing a deep generative model by neural variational inference. It has the advantages
that: 1) it can transfer knowledge between classes and even recognize new classes by learning
class structures; 2) variational method with reparameterization trick efficiently samples the latent
representation to model probability distritbutions; 3) neural networks is flexible for training and finetuning
on different datasets. -->
